There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
 there is an edge between the cities.The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takes
 to reach city B from A or the amount of fuel used for the journey.Represent this as a
 graph.The node can be represented by the airport name or name of the city.Use
 adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the
 graph.Check whether the graph is connected or not.

OUTPUT:
Enter number of cities: 4
Enter number of flights: 3
Enter flight details (source destination cost):
0 1 10
1 2 15
2 3 20

Adjacency Matrix:
0 10 0 0 
10 0 15 0 
0 15 0 20 
0 0 20 0 

The graph is CONNECTED.
